In lecture 2, Prof. Fu introduces UNIX and GNU Linux operating systems and some frequently used commands in shell. He encourage every student to install a Linux on his/her laptop to get familiar with in the following several weeks. 

Knowing Linux may seem peripheral for this course but it is **really** useful if working on a server is a part of your future career. Most servers are equipped with a Linux operating system, whether it is CentOS, Ubuntu or other distributions. Basis of Linux can help you be more competitive when applying for an intern to boost your grad application. Besides, many scientific framework is running in Linux.

I prepared a note of common bash commands. Hope it is useful.
